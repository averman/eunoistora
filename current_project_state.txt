### Purpose of the Webpage

The webpage is designed to host a visual novel game, providing an interactive and engaging experience for users. The primary goal is to present a narrative-driven game where players make choices that influence the story's direction. This webpage serves as the front-end interface for the game, offering various functionalities to control and interact with the game's elements.

### General Design and Functions

#### Design

The design of the webpage is casual and user-friendly, featuring big, bold fonts, pastel color schemes, and rounded rectangle visuals to create a welcoming and pleasant aesthetic. The layout is organized into multiple tabs, each serving a distinct purpose related to the game.

#### Functions

1. **Tab Structure**:
   - The webpage includes multiple tabs for different functionalities: the game's visual interface, a system dashboard, and a custom logging interface.

2. **Game Visual Tab**:
   - This tab contains the main game interface, showcasing the visual novel aspect.
   - It features layering of images for the background, characters, text-box, and choice/input box, which can be dynamically changed based on the game's progression.
   - The images are controlled via a context-based global state, allowing for real-time updates and interactions.

3. **System Dashboard Tab**:
   - This tab is designed for administrative purposes, such as managing API keys needed by the game and viewing the state of various game entities.
   - It functions as an entity explorer, providing insights into the game's internal workings.

4. **Custom Logging Interface Tab**:
   - Dedicated to tracking and displaying custom logs, this tab is essential for debugging and monitoring the game's operational aspects.

5. **Context API for State Management**:
   - The webpage utilizes React's Context API for global state management, enabling components to share state efficiently and respond to user interactions.
   - A centralized `GameContext` manages the state and functions like `setImage` to manipulate the game's visual aspects.

6. **CSS Customization**:
   - Custom CSS is applied for styling, aligning with the casual and friendly theme of the game.
   - Bootstrap is integrated for responsive design and standard UI components, further customized to match the game's theme.

### Summary

The webpage is a front-end platform for a visual novel game, distinguished by its user-friendly design, interactive elements, and a clear separation of concerns through a tabbed interface. It effectively combines React's advanced features with custom styling to deliver a seamless gaming experience. The use of global state management via Context API ensures smooth and dynamic interactions within the game.

## Visual Novel Game Interface - React/TypeScript Implementation

### File Structure

- **`src/GameInterface.tsx`**: Component for displaying the game's visual layers.
- **`src/GameTab.tsx`**: Tab component where the game interface is used.
- **`src/GameContext.tsx`**: Context for global game state management.
- **`src/CustomStyles.css`**: Custom styles for the game interface.
- **`public/images/`**: Directory for storing game images.

### `GameInterface.tsx`

This component handles the visual layers of the game, including background, character images, text box, and choice box.

```tsx
// GameInterface.tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useGame } from './GameContext';

const GameInterface: React.FC = ( ) => {
  const { backgroundImage, characterImage, showTextbox, showChoiceBox, setImage } = useGame();

  return (
    <div className="game-interface">
      {backgroundImage && <div className="background-layer" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${backgroundImage})` }}></div>}
      {characterImage && <div className="character-layer" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${characterImage})` }}></div>}
      {showTextbox && <div className="text-box-layer">Text Box Content</div>}
      {showChoiceBox && <div className="choice-box-layer">Choice Box Content</div>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default GameInterface;
```

### `GameTab.tsx`

This tab contains the game's interface and is responsible for rendering the `GameInterface` component.

```tsx
// GameTab.tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import GameInterface from './GameInterface';
import { useGame } from './GameContext';


const GameTab: React.FC = () => {

  const { setImage } = useGame();

  useEffect(() => {
    setImage('background', 'bg1');
    setImage('background', 'lily1');
  }, [setImage]);

  return (
    <div>
      <GameInterface />
    </div>
  );
};

export default GameTab;
```

### `GameContext.tsx`

Provides a global context for managing the game's state, such as image layers and visibility of text/choice boxes. It includes the `setImage` function to update the game's visual elements.

```tsx
// GameContext.tsx
import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react';

// Define the shape of your context's state
interface GameState {
  backgroundImage: string;
  characterImage: string;
  showTextbox: boolean;
  showChoiceBox: boolean;
  setImage: (layer: string, imageId: string) => void;
}

// Define the initial state
const initialState: GameState = {
  backgroundImage: '',
  characterImage: '',
  showTextbox: false,
  showChoiceBox: false,
  setImage: () => {}
};

export const GameContext = createContext<GameState>(initialState);

export const useGame = () => useContext(GameContext);

interface GameProviderProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export const GameProvider: React.FC<GameProviderProps> = ({ children }) => {
  const [backgroundImage, setBackgroundImage] = useState<string>(initialState.backgroundImage);
  const [characterImage, setCharacterImage] = useState<string>(initialState.characterImage);
  const [showTextbox, setShowTextbox] = useState<boolean>(initialState.showTextbox);
  const [showChoiceBox, setShowChoiceBox] = useState<boolean>(initialState.showChoiceBox);



  // Define your image map here
  const imageMap: { [key: string]: string } = {
    'bg1': 'assets/backgrounds/bg1.png',
    'lily1': 'assets/chars/lily/f-lily1.png',
    // ... more images
  };

  const setImage = (layer: string, imageId: string) => {
    switch (layer) {
      case 'background':
        setBackgroundImage(imageMap[imageId]);
        break;
      case 'character':
        setCharacterImage(imageMap[imageId]);
        break;
      case 'textbox':
        setShowTextbox(imageId !== ''); // Use the imageId to toggle the textbox
        // Optionally, you can manage the text content here
        break;
      case 'choicebox':
        setShowChoiceBox(imageId !== ''); // Use the imageId to toggle the choice box
        // Optionally, manage choice content here
        break;
      default:
        // Handle any unexpected cases
        break;
    }
  };

  return (
    <GameContext.Provider value={{ backgroundImage, characterImage, showTextbox, showChoiceBox, setImage }}>
      {children}
    </GameContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### `CustomStyles.css`

Contains custom CSS for styling the game's interface, including styles for the visual layers, text boxes, and choice boxes.

```css
/* CustomStyles.css */
/* Styles for game interface, text boxes, and other UI elements */
```

### Integration

1. **Context Provider**: Wrap the main App component with `GameProvider` from `GameContext.tsx` to provide global state access.
2. **Using Context**: Use the `useGame` hook in any component to access and modify the game's state, like changing images or showing/hiding text boxes.
3. **Styling**: Apply styles from `CustomStyles.css` to the components for a cohesive look and feel.

### Image Storage

- Store static game images in the `public/images/` directory.
- Access images in the game using relative paths (e.g., `/images/background1.jpg`).
